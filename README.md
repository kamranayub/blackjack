# WPF Blackjack Sample Game

![Screenshot](Screenshot.png)

This is a sample game I created years ago when I began to learn WPF and OO design. I'm ashamed of some
of the code but it's actually pretty darn good for one of my pet project apps. It was written to be a sample
app but it was also a lot of fun. I think I gave up when I couldn't figure out how to implement the card
counting algorithms.

Feel free to learn from and dissect the code. This was written when WPF was cool (hey, it still kinda is!).
Some of the code logic around decks and card counting was taken from other open source Blackjack games
back in the day (I'm sure they're still around) but I'm not sure if they all work like they're supposed to.

## TODO

- It would be neat to turn this into a Windows 8 app + C#
- If someone can implement better AI and deck dealing, be my guest
- Implement the status bar area
- Implement betting
- Implement MVVM
